# Virtual Thing
A simulation engine for Things, allows to instantiate simulated Things with behavior defined by means of a [Virtual Thing Description][vtd] - a [Thing Description][td] complemented by simulation-specific entries.

## Build
Is built as part of the `Shadow Thing`.

## Run
Is embedded into the `Shadow Thing`. Can, however, be used as a standalone application by means of the built-in [CLI][cli].
